# Forkwell Coronavirus Hack: Drug Discovery
This is a submission to the [Forkwell Coronavirus Hack Competition](https://www.forkwell.io/events/forkwell-coronavirus-hack) under the **Drug Discovery** category.

The goal of this category is to create a novel small molecule or find existing drugs on the market that are able to stop or interfere with the coronavirus lifecyle. Therefore, one of the approaches to this is to find out the drugs/ligands that are able to bind with the [coronavirus main protease 6LU7](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6lu7). 

Several researches and experiments have been conducted and recorded in the [DrugBank paper](https://drugbank.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/blog/COVID-19_Web.pdf). We then use the data to determine our evaluation target. 

Below are samples of existing drugs that have been experimented with the coronavirus binding: 

| Drugs/Ligands        | Binding Score           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|   Remdesivir    | -7.4 |
|   Umifenovir    | -6.1     |
|   Favipiravir | -5.6     |
|   Lopinavir | -6.6     |
|   Ritonavir | -6.2     |
|   Galidesivir | -5.6     |
|   Favipiravir | -5.6     |
|   Triazavirin | -5.9     |
|   Chloroquine | -5.6     |
|   Darunavir | -7.2     |
|   TMC-310911 | -8.9     |

Table 1.1 shows the existing drugs with their respective binding score.

1. A file will be created in `generations/master_results_table_final.csv`. This file can be validated by bioinformatics.



# Introduction
## local-GA
In this project, we introduced a new concept - local Genetic Algorithm (local-GA), an evolutionary computing optimization method. We plan to keep things easy and simple as the [original repository](https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA) is well-maintained and is already ready for usage.

Our method utilizes cross-over and mutation to search for the most suitable molecule in the chemical space based on its fitness function.

We implement the local-GA in 2 areas (details in next section):
1. Before Transfer Learning 
1. Before exporting the molecule to the sdf file format
### **Population: The original molecule**
- The initial population depends on the molecules we compute before passing it on to the local-GA. 
- The first local-GA will select of 70 molecules based on `score`, `similarity` and `log(P)`, together with some random selections. 
- In the second local-GA, the validated molecules from the 5000 generated molecule after transfer learning is used.

### **Mating Pool: The molecules we want to pass from generation by generation**
We select the molecules we need from the population to the mating pool based on the fitness function. 

### **Cross-Over: Exchange part of 2 molecules to generate 2 new Molecules**
The system will first randomly select 2 molecules for crossover at ring or non-ring with equal probability. If the two molecules does not have a valid structure for crossover, it will not be used:
- If a ring structure is selected for crossover, we randomly pick one of the edges of the ring 
- If a non-ring structure is selected for crossover, one of the single bonds (not in ring) will be selected randomly.

We then rejoin these broken molecules and combine them to form 2 new molecules. 2 new molecules will be returned from this function.

### **Mutation: Mutate part of a molecule**
The molecule will undergo 7 processes separately and a random position on the molecule will be selected to do mutation by the function based on their requirements:

  - `insert_atom()`\
    A random bond is selected and classified into 3 categories based on their charge: -1, -2, -3, these information are taken into consideration so that the product will have a valid chemical structure.
  - `change_bond_order()`\
    It gives the new molecule a different shape, while having the same atoms as the original.
  - `delete_cyclic_bond()`\
    One of the ring inside the molecule will be removed.
  - `add_ring()`\
    A ring will be added in a single bond between 2 molecules.
  - `delete_atom()`\
    A random ion will be removed.
  - `change_atom(mol)`\
    A random ion is selected and replaced by another molecule with the same charge as it.
  - `append_atom()`\
    An atom will be selected and the number of hydrogen atoms around it will be used to decide the type of inserted ion (if 1 then an ion with charge -1 will be used; if 2 then an ion with charge -2 will be used; etc.). The new atom will replace the hydrogen(s) and form a new molecule.

  After these 7 processes, one of them will be selected and returned if it is valid.

### **Fitness Function**
The fitness function is the evaluation criteria in every generation based on the `log(P)` value. According to ["logP — Making Sense of the Value" by Sanjivanjit K. Bhal](https://www.acdlabs.com/download/app/physchem/making_sense.pdf), the oral administration of drug should be lower than `5` and best between `1.35` and `1.80`.

`log(P)` is used in the pharmaceutical/biotech industries to help understand the behavior of drug molecules in the body. Drug candidates are often screened according to `log(P)` among other criteria, to help guide drug selection and analog optimization. This is because lipophilicity is a major determining factor in a compound’s absorption, distribution in the body, penetration across vital membranes and biological barriers, metabolism and excretion (ADME properties). According to ‘Lipinski’s Rule of 5’ (developed at Pfizer) the `log(P)` of a compound intended for oral administration should be `<5`. A more lipophilic compound:

- Will have low aqueous solubility, compromising bioavailability. If an adequate concentration of a drug cannot be reached or maintained, even the most potent in-vitro substance cannot be an effective drug.
- May be sequestered by fatty tissue and therefore difficult to excrete; in turn leading to accumulation that will impact the systemic toxicity of the substance.
- May not be ideal for penetration through certain barriers. A drug targeting the central nervous system (CNS) should ideally have a `log(P)` value around `2`, for oral and intestinal absorption `1.35–1.8`, while a drug intended for sub-lingual absorption should have a `log(P)` value of `>5`.

Not only does `log(P)` help predict the likely transport of a compound around the body. It also affects formulation, dosing, drug clearance, and toxicity. Though it is not the only determining factor in these issues, it plays a critical role in helping scientists limit the liabilities of new drug candidates.


# Methodology
## Reference Approach - _[mattroconnor/Deep_Learning_Coronavirus_Cure](https://github.com/mattroconnor/deep_learning_coronavirus_cure)_

Global-Generation 0:

1. LSTM-CHEM to train ChEMBL Database
1. From LSTM CHEM, 10k molecules were generated.
1. Validility of molecules were checked.
1. Compute Tanimoto similarity and select 1000 molecules.
1. IDs were given to the 1000 SMILE files, while the HIV and other drugs' SMILE files were added manually.
1. All molecules were saved in the master table and manually checked from PyRX to get the binding affinity.

While each Global-Generation < n, 

7. From the master table (loaded from Global-Generation), we select:
    - 35 molecules based on score
    - 5 molecules based on the similarity
    - 5 molecules based on the weight
    - 5 molecules based on the random mutation
  
8. From the 55 generated molecules, transfer learning is done. 5000 molecules are then generated, and undergo similarity and validation test. 5000 molecules were then generated, validated, checked for similarity and finally added to the master table.

## Our Approach
Global-Generation 0:
1. LSTM-CHEM to train ChEMBL Database
1. From LSTM CHEM, we generate 10k molecules.
1 Validility of molecules were checked.
1. Compute Tanimoto similarity and select 1000 molecules.
1. IDs were given to the 1000 SMILE files, while other drugs' SMILE files were added manually.
1. All molecules were saved in the master table and manually checked from PyRX to get the binding affinity.

While each Global-Generation < n, 

7. From the master table (loaded from Global-Generation), we select the molecules based on the following attributes with respect to the proportions:
    | Attribute | No of Selections (Generations 0-10) | No of Selections (In generations 11 & 12) |
    | --- | :---: | :---: |
    | Score       | 35 | 55 |
    | Similarity  | 10 | 10 |
    | log(P)      | 10 | 65 |
    | Weights     | 5  | 10 |
    | Random      | 5  | 5  |

1. We then pass the obtained molecules the to local-GA to further obtain 10 molecules that have `log(P)` of 1.35-1.80.
1. By using 90 molecules, we perform `transfer learning` to generate 5,000 molecules.
1. We then do validation on the 5000 generated molecules to discard the invalid molecules.
1. 50 extra molecules are then generated using local-GA which has a `log(P)` value of `1.35-1.8`. 
1. The 50 molecules are validated and combined with molecule from `Step 10`.
1. The molecules were then exported to the sdf file format.
1. `PyRX` was used to minimize the energy of the molecules and export the `.sdf` file into `.pdbqt` files.
1. The files were then organized into folders (depending on how many parallel sessions we want to run) using [a PowerShell script](./scripts/folderSplitter/shard.ps1).
1. Binding calculation [relevant files and configurations](./scripts/binding) were copied into each folder and the folders were distributed among our group members.
1. The output files are collected from our group members once its finished processing and compiled into a `.csv` file using [a PowerShell script](./scripts/conversion/conversion.ps1) and [a NodeJS script](./scripts/conversion/convert.js).
1. The results are interpreted and the process starts from `7` until a satisfactory result is achived or when the tester decides to stop.

# Side Notes & Challenges Faced
## Methodology Discussion
1. Our group initially intended to use the `Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)` as our neural network instead of the currently used `Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)` network. However after discussion we found out that it may be not necessary to use `GAN`, as `LSTM` is quite good enough while `GAN` is more expensive as it uses more computing power and thus require longer training times.

1. Our group initially wanted to use neural networks to predict protein-ligand binding affinity as stated in the [DLSCORE](https://github.com/sirimullalab/dlscore) repository. However after extensive discussions we decided not to do so, as DLSCORE **only predicts** the binding affinity, which may be dangerous as it may contain errors.

## Computational Implementations
In our project, we used a combination of software available in the market, including `python`, `NodeJS`, `PyRX`, `AutoDock Vina`, `Open Babel` and `Microsoft PowerShell` to accelerate our processes.\
The total speedup is about 5-6 times, accelerating a 10 hour workload to about less than 2 hours.

### Sharding of workload
Initially during our project, our group had to run all conversion and docking on the same computer. As PyRx is quite unstable, we often encounter multiple crashes that forced us to re-run that generation.\
After some discussions, we seperated the doking process into 3 parts: 
- Converting\
    Where the sdf files are being minimized and converted into `.pdbqt` files using PyRx. This process is quite quick and stable, and as such we did not find an alternative.

- Sharding\
    Where the converted pdbqt files were seperated into multiple folders via [a PowerShell script](./scripts/folderSplitter/shard.ps1).\
    The folders were then compressed,, [relevant files](./scripts/binding) included and distributed to the cloud or our group members.

- Converting\
    After the computing is complete, the outputs (custom extension - `.pdbqt_out`) are consolidated. [A PowerShell script](./scripts/conversion/conversion.ps1) calls a [NodeJS Script](./scripts/conversion/convert.js) to obtain the `binding affinity` from the files and writes it into [a csv file](./scripts/conversion/results.csv).

### Usage of cloud computing
As the workload has been sharded, multiple instances of the docking program can be run at once. According to our observations, the `exhaustiveness` number in the AutoDock Vina process corresponds to the number of CPU cores used. \
We therefore used this knowledge to provision a cloud server containing 16 cores. In total with our group members, this meant that we had 66 CPU cores at our disposal. 


# Future work 
1. Increase the number of generations  
1. Change local-GA parameters
1. Change the base network to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
1. To compute binding affinity for all drugs in market(~450,000) and using the results to generate gen0
1. GPU based docking for faster evaluation
1. Implement ranked based or tournament selection to the Local Genetic Algorithm.
